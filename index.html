                I am at university and right now I am trying to pass and 
                leave this place. Im interesting in Web Development 
                because I did it before and the code for it seems easy 
                enough.

                    "Need for Speed" series. The game is set in an

                    Firstly, Underground 2 is known for its extensive 
                    vehicle customization options. Players can modify 
                    and personalize their cars with various visual 
                    upgrades, including body kits, rims, vinyl graphics, 
                    and more. This aspect adds a layer of depth and 
                    personalization to the gameplay. The game features 
                    an open-world environment, the fictional city of 
                    Bayview. Players can freely explore the city, 
                    discover hidden races, and find shops for car 
                    upgrades. The open-world design offers a sense of 
                    freedom and exploration. The game offers a variety 
                    of race modes, including circuit races, sprint races, 
                    drag races, and drift races. This diversity keeps the 
                    gameplay engaging, and players can choose their 
                    preferred racing style. And Last but not least, 
                    Underground 2 features a memorable and diverse 
                    soundtrack with tracks from various genres (mostly 
                    rock & roll and rap music) enhancing the overall 
                    gaming experience. 
                    <br><br>
                    If you enjoy customizing cars 
                    and street racing, this game is worth checking out 
                    for its nostalgic and immersive gameplay.
